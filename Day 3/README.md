# Day 3 - Concatenation
## Concepts Practiced
- Learned the concept of 'concatenation'.
- Learned how to combine texts (_strings_) and variables together into single sentences.

Project 3: The Ultimate Wacky Recipe Maker

Built a recipe generater program using previously learnt concepts such as _print_ and _input_ commands, and using variables to store user inputs. The program outputs the 'recepie' using _concatenate_.
