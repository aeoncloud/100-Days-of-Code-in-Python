# DAY 3 - Concatenation
## Concepts Practiced
- Learned the concept of 'concatenation'.
- Learned how to combine texts (_strings_) and variables together into single sentences.
- Debugged common coding error such as SyntaxError.

## Learning Outcome
Project 3: The Ultimate Wacky Recipe Maker!

I built a whacky recipe maker by using _concatenation_, and previously learnt concepts such as _print_ and _input_ commands and used _variables_ to store user inputs.
