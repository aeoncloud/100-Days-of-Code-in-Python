# DAY 7 - Nesting

## Concepts Learned
- Learned about the concept of ***Nesting***.
    - ***Nesting*** is where we put an _if_ statement within an _if_ statement using indentation. The second _if_ statement within the first if statement must be indented and its _print_ statement needs to be indented one more time.
- Practiced ***Nesting*** using previously learned concepts such as _input_ comnand, _variables_, _if/else_ statements, _elif_ statement, and _print_ command.
- Debugged common coding errors such as NameError, SyntaxError and IndentationError.

## Learning Output

Project 7: FAKE ANIME FAN FINDER.

Using _Nesting_ and previously learned concepts, I built a game to test if you are a true fan of 'Naruto' anime TV show.
