- Learned about Boolean Operators such as ***and***, ***or*** and ***not***.
- Practiced _if_ and _elif_ statements using previously learned concepts such as _input_ command and _variables_.
- Debugged common coding errors such as NameError, SyntaxError and IndentationError.

## Learning Outcome
Project 6: User login system.
