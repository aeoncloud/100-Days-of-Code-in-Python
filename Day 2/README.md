# DAY 2 - Input and Variables
## Concepts Practiced
- Learned about 'input' command and how to take user input.
- Learned the concept of a 'variable', how to name a variable, and then how to print it.
- Debugged common coding errors such as NameError and SyntaxError.

## Learning Outcome
Project 2: Getting to know you Project!

I just built my first interactive code which takes inputs from the user. The program asks for the user's name, favorite food, favorite music and where they live!
