# DAY 4 - Challenge Day!
The challenge is to build a program that asks for bunch of key facts about the user, then weaves it together in a custom story that will be just about that person. Basically, build a custom story for the users.
## Approach
- Ask the users to list a bunch of information about them: things they like, things they  hate, names of family and friends.
    - Using _variables_ and _input_ command.
- Construct the story - basically anything you want.
    - Using _concatenation_ and the use of  ,  and  ""
- One paragraph at a time using _print_ command.
